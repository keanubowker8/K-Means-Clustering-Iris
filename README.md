K-Means clustering is an unsupervised learning technique used in processes such as market segmentation, document clustering, image segmentation and image compression. Usually we do K-Means clustering to:

- Understand the structure of the data, and group similar observations.
- sCluster the data into subgroups and then do different predictions on the different subgroups. If we think that subgroup behaviours differ substantially, then we will get more accurate models by making separate models for each subgroup, than one model for all groups.
